      <h3>Review</h3>
      <p>Three Olive is the kind of spot that feels like a little hidden gem. It’s filled with plants, sunlight, and friendly faces. The coffee is rich, the pastries are flaky and fresh, and there’s a calmness to the atmosphere that makes it perfect for reading, journaling, or chatting with a friend. Definitely one of FiFi’s top café picks in North London!</p>
